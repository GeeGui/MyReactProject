// This code represents an array of objects called "FakeDoctors" which contains information about different doctors. Each object represents a specific doctor and has properties such as "id", "name", "status", and "img" (image URL). 
 
// The "FakeDoctors" array contains multiple objects, each representing a different doctor. For example: 
 
// - The first object represents a doctor named "Darry Milin". It has an ID of "001", a name of "Darry Milin", a status of "Oral Surgeon", and an image URL of "https://i.ibb.co/pz92gsK/d1.png". 
 
// - The second object represents a doctor named "Salman Ahmed". It has an ID of "002", a name of "Salman Ahmed", a status of "Oral Surgeon", and an image URL of "https://i.ibb.co/yRcJ55b/d2.png". 
 
// - The third object represents a doctor named "Santa Binte". It has an ID of "003", a name of "Santa Binte", a status of "Oral Surgeon", and an image URL of "https://i.ibb.co/zJXZcqW/d3.png". 
 
// This data can be used in a React component to display information about different doctors. For example, you can map through the "FakeDoctors" array and render a component for each doctor, displaying their name, status, and image. 
 
// Overall, this code provides a structured way to store and access information about different doctors, which can be used to dynamically render components or display information on a website or application.
