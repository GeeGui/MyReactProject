// This code represents an array of objects called "FakeService" which contains information about different services or qualifications. Each object represents a specific service and has properties such as "id", "title", "description", "link", and "img" (image URL). 
 
// The "FakeService" array contains multiple objects, each representing a different service or qualification. For example: 
 
// - The first object represents a service titled "Registered Nurse". It has an ID of "001", a title of "Registered Nurse", a description of "August 2019 - Present", a link text of "Read More", and an image URL of "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saifulemon/images-for-all-project/main/Donto/Features/feature2.svg". 
 
// - The second object represents a service titled "Certified Nurse Assistant". It has an ID of "002", a title of "Certified Nurse Assistant", a description of "June 2017 - Present", a link text of "Read More", and an image URL of "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saifulemon/images-for-all-project/main/Donto/Features/feature2.svg". 
 
// Each object in the array represents a different service or qualification, along with its associated information. 
 
// This data can be used in a React component to display information about different services or qualifications. For example, you can map through the "FakeService" array and render a component for each service, displaying its title, description, link, and image. 
 
// Overall, this code provides a structured way to store and access information about different services or qualifications, which can be used to dynamically render components or display information on a website or application.
